                <h2>What Is An ADU Or Casita?</h2><br />
                <p className="body">
                    An ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) refers to a secondary residential unit that is typically added to a single-family residential property. It is also known by other names such as "granny flat," "in-law suite," or "backyard cottage." ADUs are considered additional housing units on a property and are designed to accommodate independent living. They are typically smaller in size compared to the primary dwelling and can be attached or detached from the main house. ADUs can provide additional living space, offer rental income opportunities, or serve as housing for family members or caregivers. ADUs have gained popularity as a means to address housing shortages, increase housing density, and provide flexible living arrangements.
                    <br /><br />
                    Sometimes the space you currently have does not fit your familyâ€™s needs. Your family may be growing, or your parents may be moving in, and they want their own, private space. You may also simply want to expand the square footage of your home and start renting to people without giving up your privacy. An accessory dwelling unit, or ADU, is the perfect solution.
                    Accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, are one of the smartest investments you can make as a Austin Texas homeowner. You might also hear them referred to as granny flats, in-law suites, and casitas. A new ADU can solve many problems while adding value to your property.

                <h2>Should You Build an ADU in Austin Texas?</h2><br />
                <p className="body">
                    With its beautiful weather and the number of things to do in the area, finding a new home in Austin Texas can be very difficult and expensive. Growing families require more space, though. You should not have to give up your current property just to find another, bigger space to accommodate your needs. This just brings unnecessary stress into your life. Rather than looking for a new place, why not upgrade the property you already have? An accessory dwelling unit can be the answer. Arise Contractors Group will build the ADU of your dreams. The high demand and low supply for residences in Austin Texas is a problem for many people. ADUs can be a major opportunity for you to earn some extra income. When you build and rent out a granny flat, you have the option to add a significant new source of income to your wallet. You can spend that money on your mortgage, pay off loans, save up for retirement, or go on a vacation.
                    <br /><br />
                    For multigenerational families, finding a safe place for your parents to stay as they grow old can be especially difficult. You need somewhere close to you, but specifically designed with their safety and abilities in mind. A brand new ADU can be customized for aging in place, and having your parents live nearby is a win for everyone. There is nothing more valuable than their safety, so get a space that is designed for them. A project of this size requires the right people to do it. Converting an existing structure into an ADU may allow you to use the plumbing and electrical that already runs through your house but building a detached ADU requires new plumbing systems or adjustments to your existing system. This takes a skilled hand, and without a great team behind you, your ADU may not last as long as it should. Arise Contractors Group has the tools, skills, and team to make your accessory dwelling unit great. Our design team can take key factors you want and include them in the final design, so your ADU feels like an extension of your existing property. Increase the value of your property and fall back in love with your home! Call us today so we can give you a free consultation.

                        <h3>1. Detached ADUs</h3> <br />
                        <p className="body">
                            <ul>
                                <li>The typical ADU is built in this style, usually in the backyard.</li> 
                                <li>A separate, standalone building, detached ADUs are not physically connected to the main residence in any way. The size is also not limited by the size of the main dwelling, like in attached suites, allowing for more freedom in design.</li>
                                <li>Detached residences also offer the most privacy for everyone on the property. This is perfect for families who want their parents to live close to them or for people looking to start an Airbnb without sacrificing independence and privacy.</li>
                                <li>Existing buildings, such as detached garages, can be easily converted into detached ADUs.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>2. Attached ADUs</h3> <br />
                        <p className="body">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Attached ADUs are similar to building a room addition onto your home, as they are connected to the main residence.</li>
                                <li>The difference between the two is that attached ADUs must be internally isolated from the main residence, with their own entrance, bathroom and kitchen. They could share a wall with your home, but no entrances or windows connect the two spaces.</li>
                                <li>Attached ADUs provide a moderate amount of privacy while still allowing easy access to and from both dwellings, which makes them a great idea for housing elderly parents or if you want to use the ADU as a gym or office.</li>
                                <li>Just keep in mind that their size is limited by the size of the primary dwelling. The structure cannot exceed 50-percent of the total floor area of the primary residence when completed.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>3. Repurposed existing ADUs</h3> <br />

                                <li>Converting your garage, attic, or basement are all options for potential granny flats.</li>
                                <li>These types of accessory dwelling units allow the homeowner to make the most out of their home, repurposing old and unused spaces into new living or working areas.</li>
                                <li>You cannot change the original floor plan of the space when converting it.</li>
                                <li>Repurposed Existing ADUs provide the least amount of privacy but are the most convenient to access Repurposed spaces provide the least amount of privacy but are the most convenient to access.</li>
                                <li>While attached accessory dwelling units are great for families, so are repurposed garages. They allow your parents or loved ones to live under the same roof, even if their privacy is reduced. This option also tends to be the cheapest since you are reusing existing structures.</li>

                    <h3>Award winning custom whole home remodeling contractors in Austin Texas</h3>
                    <p className="body">
                        One of the most common reasons for whole home remodeling is that a one room remodel simply is not enough. Many home owners have started a project in one part of the house, only to realize how badly another room needs improvement. Adding an air conditioner in your bedroom is great for when youâ€™re sleeping but putting in ducts and vents to cool every room is an even better way to stay cool. There is not much point in adding energy-efficient lighting in one bathroom when the other still leaves you with an enormous electrical bill. One updated modern room surrounded by decades-old designs will stick out and distract. When you do a whole home renovation, you get the opportunity to make your home feel whole, rather than a collection of spaces from different times and different themes.
                            <br />
                        Arise Contractors Group is an award-winning, whole house remodeling contractor serving the Austin Texas area.

                <h2>Can i build my own ADU?</h2><br />
                <p className="body">
                    The smaller, simpler design of ADUs may lead some homeowners to try to take on the project themselves, going the DIY route. However, it is far more complicated than it sounds.  County requires an Owner-Builder Declaration to get a building permit; this document puts you in charge of enormous liability. It also clears your homeownerâ€™s insurance of covering injuries such as falling off a ladder, potentially leaving you with massive medical bills. Going the DIY route puts others at risk, too. The law considers anyone who helps you on any project that costs more than $500 to be your employee. You will be required to pay for disability insurance, unemployment, have taxes withheld, and register for an EIN on the state and federal level. Also, if you sell your property, future homeowners can hold you liable for injuries and damages that occur due to your construction.
                    <br /><br />
                    This is why having a quality construction company is so important when you are looking to add an ADU to your property. At Arise Contractors Group, we specialize in delivering ADUs quickly and efficiently, so you donâ€™t have to spend extra money on renewing permits or additional inspections. We build all our buildings with high-quality materials and skill while ensuring we keep costs in check and the project within budget. Because ADUs are often standalone structures, they require new foundations, new walls, plumbing, electric, heating and cooling and a separate roof. As such, itâ€™s extremely important to hire a company with significant experience building stand-alone structures like casitas. Arise Contractors Group is one of Austin Texasâ€™s leading full service remodeling companies. Remember, every project is different, and you should not accept cookie cutter options for any home addition. Call the experts at Arise Contractors Group today.
